* ia_calculate_and_capture needs cleaning up.  Things we should do:
    1. Find a better way to log stuff to the stdout.
    
* Allow user to control when to see the process.
* There is an issue when calling with a configuration file.  I think it
  has to do with the fact that the values in the config file don't fall
  in the correct place in the camera matrix.  But without a config it seems to
  work fine.
* Rename the initial calculate function to demo or something like "demo"
