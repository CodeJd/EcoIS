* ia_calculate_and_capture needs cleaning up.  Things we should do:
    1. Find a better way to log stuff to the stdout.
    2. Think of a better way of doing the rotation and translation adjustments.

* Make the command save the images in a directory.
* Remove the distance argument.
* Allow user to control when to see the process.
* There is some repeated logic in ia_core.cpp, fix that!!!!.
* Rename the initial calculate function to demo or something like "demo"
